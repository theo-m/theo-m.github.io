This looks nice. Followed this fine [blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to get everything running.

I'll run it through a custom domain soon.

#### Tests

Is mathjax running? Trying as per this [blog post](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/)
And inline? see this \\( \alpha \\)

$$ \sum x = \int y^e $$

~~ And this [blog post](http://csega.github.io/mypost/2017/03/28/how-to-set-up-mathjax-on-jekyll-and-github-properly.html) helped too. ~~

But `redcarpet` is not supported by GH anymore, so switching to `kramdown`, though I expect it to break Mathjax.

-> it doesn't, but no strikethrough and it looks like code highlighting is a mess


With kramdown code blocks ~
~~~python
import numpy as np


def emb_from_binary(fp, norm=True, verbose=True, threshold=0):
    ''' Read vectors from binary file formatted as
            words,size
            word1 coord1coord2...coordn
            ...
    '''

    fi_vect = open(fp, 'rb')
    words, size = map(int, fi_vect.readline().decode('utf-8').split())

    emb_from_binary.errors = 0

~~~

With classical marks
```python
import numpy as np


def emb_from_binary(fp, norm=True, verbose=True, threshold=0):
    ''' Read vectors from binary file formatted as
            words,size
            word1 coord1coord2...coordn
            ...
    '''

    fi_vect = open(fp, 'rb')
    words, size = map(int, fi_vect.readline().decode('utf-8').split())

    emb_from_binary.errors = 0

```
