If you can't watch this excerpt, it comes from the U.S. comedy show The Office. Character Kevin Malone, an overweight simpleton, starts talking without the use of any syntax nor grammar in an attempt to save time.  
Upon confrontation with his boss, he is asked what this time will be used for.  
> -- `PB:` *What are you going to do with this time?*  
> -- `KM:` *See world*  
> -- `JH:` *Are you saying see **the** world or Sea World?*  
> -- `KM:` *See world; ocean, sea, fish, jump, China.*  

This is a fun example to show how disambiguation works, and a good one too.

## Why disambiguate?

Natural, triangular inequality.

But shouldn't it be already in the embedding? Arora+russes
