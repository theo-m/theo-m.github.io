title: An attempt at a minimal sense model

I have conceived it as a toy framework to try to make sense out of the different evaluation models that I could find.

It is built in analogy to that of modern probability theory.

$$ \begin{align} \Omega & = \left\{ \text{meanings} \right\} \\ & = \left\{ showt \right\} \end{align} $$
