### Papers


You can see my bibliography in bibtex format [here](/report.bib). I also maintain a Google Spreadsheet that helps me keep my sanity, you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UR2J7MvkZ5xuGmp7l0F6hMJoEWjWhYsC0JCCWnUfZe4/edit?usp=sharing). (That was before finding out about Mendeley, which seems like a good tool. I'm keeping the spreadsheet though as I have gotten used to it.)
