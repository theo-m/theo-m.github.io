        <h1>Internship at FAIR</h1><time>September 11, 2018</time></header><p><strong>tldr:</strong> worked on dialogue evaluation, <a href="/dialogeval.pdf">the report is here</a>.</p>
<p>Joining FAIR was a long and winding road.
During fall 2017 I had been reading some papers about emergent communication and found the question it raised resonated particularly with me.
My masters degree required a research internship so I looked up who I could work with on such topic and found that Marco Baroni was at Facebook AI Research in Paris.</p>
<p>I reached out, we met and talked and it was going great, I was referred and had a coding interview and a more &ldquo;research&rdquo; oriented one with two senior FAIR researchers.</p>
<p>Things happened and I was re-oriented to the engineering team for the internship to work on dialogue systems.
I joined the dedicated team there and started the first weeks tweaking transformer architectures for the PersonaChat task.
The commonly accepted strategy was to try each model manually and deciding on whether or not they were better or worse than the previous ones.</p>
<p>So after a few weeks I talked about this to my advisor and we shifted the focus of the internship so that I could explore automatic evaluation of dialogue systems.</p>
