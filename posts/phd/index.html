        <h1>Emerging communications</h1><time>November 12, 2018</time></header><p><strong>tldr:</strong> wrote a PhD proposition, did not do the PhD, <a href="/emergent_phd_prop.pdf">the document is here</a></p>
<p>During the internship the PhD plan was growing more and more mature.
So when it ended in the last days of August we moved on to write a formal thesis proposition.</p>
<p>That process was both exhilerating and stressful.
Exhilerating because I basically made it into a shopping list of the topics I wanted to explore.
Stressful because we were building a PhD between the Facebook AI labs and the Institut Jean-Nicod, a language philosophy lab at ENS, Paris.
That meant that the proposition would be read by two very different groups of people, whose expectations would surely be disappointed - I was mainly afraid of reception from the language philosophy people since I did not receive a lot of education on these topics, despite my apetite for it.</p>
