        <h1>Joining Nabla</h1><time>June 2, 2019</time></header><p>Met Alexandre Le Brun and Martin Raison during my internship at FAIR during summer &lsquo;18.
They left the office to start <a href="https://nabla.com">Nabla</a> about a month after I&rsquo;d arrived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had an interest in building things and looked for opportunities to be closer to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.
So while I was writing my PhD proposal I started part-time there to be part of the adventure and try to help where I could.</p>
<p>Once the PhD prospects died out, I joined full time as Machine Learning engineer.
During the first few months we iterated a bit with different customers but it became clear that this wasn&rsquo;t what we wanted to do, so we set out to build something for ourselves.
I think most of the frustration at the time came from not being responsible for the decision and the implementation of our product.</p>
<p>Hence the shift, and we&rsquo;re now a healthcare company!</p>
