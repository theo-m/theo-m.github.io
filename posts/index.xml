      <description>Met Alexandre Le Brun and Martin Raison during my internship at FAIR during summer &amp;lsquo;18. They left the office to start Nabla about a month after I&amp;rsquo;d arrived.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in building things and looked for opportunities to be closer to the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;. So while I was writing my PhD proposal I started part-time there to be part of the adventure and try to help where I could.</description>

      <description>tldr: wrote a PhD proposition, did not do the PhD, the document is here
During the internship the PhD plan was growing more and more mature. So when it ended in the last days of August we moved on to write a formal thesis proposition.
That process was both exhilerating and stressful. Exhilerating because I basically made it into a shopping list of the topics I wanted to explore. Stressful because we were building a PhD between the Facebook AI labs and the Institut Jean-Nicod, a language philosophy lab at ENS, Paris.</description>
