I installed Ubuntu Gnome 17.04 without any issue. I switch between Gnome and i3 quite often; I enjoy the first for its ability to make (almost) everything work out of the box, and the second because tiling windows makes me more ~~productive~~ cool.

Software I use:

* google-chrome
* spotify
* dropbox
* sublime-text
* mplayer
* zsh & prezto
