[Coolest thing](https://www.zotero.org) I've met lately; it is an open-source alternative to Mendeley, which is made by Elsevier ([b](https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2016/12/12/why-i-still-wont-review-for-or-publish-with-elsevier-and-think-you-shouldnt-either/)[o](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151103/15475732708/not-just-academics-fed-up-with-elsevier-entire-editorial-staff-resigns-en-masse-to-start-open-access-journal.shtml)[o](https://gclibrary.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2015/05/21/why-boycott/)[o](https://thedirtpsychology.org/academic-publishers-are-evil/)[o](https://lemire.me/blog/2015/05/19/putting-the-evil-academic-publishers-in-perspective/)!), that allows reference management, notes and pdfs syncing on their servers, free up to 300MB. 

I myself have paid for the 20USD/year 2GB user space. Everything has been pretty smooth, they have a desktop software that works with windows/linux & more. It is barebones, without clutter, and has support for plugins: I use [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) and [better-bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) for file management and bibtex files.  There's a great app for the Apple ecosystem, Papership, but alas none for the Android world, on which I am.

Another cool thing about Zotero is that it has a rudimentary social network component. You can follow people, create groups and share articles in them, and there's a comment functionality as well.

For another source, here is a small twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/DingemanseMark/status/936329828067872774) by a researcher, also in love with this software.

All in all you'll be able to find me [there](https://www.zotero.org/theo-m/), don't hesitate to create a group or join the dummy one I created if you want to share cool articles!
