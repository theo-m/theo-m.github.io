          <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a <em>product engineer</em> with two years of professional
            experience at <a href="https://nabla.com">Nabla</a> where I learnt
            to grow and ship human-focused products for doctors and healthcare
            workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Nabla I grew from a role of Natural Language Processing Engineer
            to full Sotfware Engineering and Product Leadership: from shipping
            <em>state of the art NLP features</em> and building ML tooling, to
            collecting user feedback and writing product specifications with a
            vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had the extraordinary chance to learn engineering and product
            development in a highly demanding environment that strived to
            implement the highest standards in terms of
            <em>privacy and software quality</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have successfully led small teams of engineers on small to bigger
            projects, onboarded new people and gave interviews. This is a role I
            strive in.

          <h2 id="what-can-i-do-for-you">What can I do for you</h2>
          <p>
            I am interested in both hands-on engineering and management roles.
            Here are some of the things I can do for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Architect and implement modern, high-quality
            <em>web applications and backend systems</em>, combining good
            programming practices and latest tools and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devise, implement, distribute and integrate
            <em>NLP and ML algorithms</em> at state-of-the-art performances into
            your products.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Build and lead small engineering teams</em> with a focus on
            autonomy and self-fulfillment in a fun and sustainable work
            environment.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            I am proficient in web application design and engineering using
            <em>React, GraphQL, TypeScript</em>, and client-side state
            management with Apollo. I have also shipped several features in
            <em>React Native</em>, but albeit proficient, I am not an expert.
          </p>
          <p>
            In parallel I am proficient in architecturing and maintaining
            performant back-end services, notably in
            <em>Golang and Kotlin</em> for GraphQL and ML microservices with
            <em>gRPC</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Facebook AI Research I have worked with the leading research team
            on <em>conversational bots</em>, where I helped explore transformer
            architecture and devised better automatic evaluation methods. At
            Nabla I have led the NLP effort and developped an in-house framework
            for research and deployment of focussed and integrated AI features.
            I have notably worked on ML Ops and delivered a self updating system
            for Named Entity Recognition in <em>Kubernetes</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about product building and building trusting
            relations with users and designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a solid grasp of
            <em>software engineering fundamentals</em> such as functional and
            object-oriented programming paradigms, relational database design,
            application and system architectures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am familiar with modern <em>cloud</em> deployment, hosting, and
            data storage strategies and architectures, though I am by no means
            an expert.

              Machine Learning Engineer (Paris, Full-time, 2018-2021)
            </p>
            <p>
              Joined the company as its 5th employee as Machine Learning
              Engineer. I built the ML tooling and models for our early
              consulting days, and then took ownership for both the engineering
              and the product development of the healthcare centric part of our
              health product.

            <p class="subtitle">Research Intern (Paris, summer 2018)</p>
            <p>
              Worked with Jason Weston's team on dialogue systems, which
              included exploring transformer-like architecture and persona-based
              bots. My main focus then became to establish solid dialogue
              automatic evaluation strategies - which tied to some theoretical
              works by XXth century philosophers, and exploiting these insights
              to inform heuristics in mini-batch compositions to improve human
              perceptions of the system's abilities.
