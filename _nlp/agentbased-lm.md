Modern system that deal with natural language do so with the help of large corpora that help build statistical models of word cooccurences.
These statistical counts enable algorithms to generate "most likely" items of language, or discriminate against "weirder" ones.

They lack the fundamental part of language; its interactivity. Language is a game we play, it is a set of constraints that have been imposed through thousands of years of experience that allow us to, at the same time, maximize our ability to describe almost every thing that can happen and minimize the energy dedicated to communication.

This minimization-maximization objective is obtained with compositionality, in two forms: semantic compositionality and syntax. The first maximizes the spectrum of the describable, the second allows for a form of compression, i.e. to get shorter signals.

Cool articles to read while I write a proper article, all of them being more on the modelling perspective rather than on the linguistic side:
