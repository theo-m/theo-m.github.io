title: About me
---


My name is Théo Matussière. I've attended the École polytechnique and recently graduated from the MVA, a research master at the ENS Cachan.

I'm interested in language emergence in societies of agents, representation learning and in optimization in a lesser extent. Although these interests are academic in nature I've also had some experience doing consulting in the industry and enjoy the challenges it offers.
