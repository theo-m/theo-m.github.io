## About me

![my face](/files/me.png)

My name is Théo Matussière, I graduated from the École polytechnique in France and am currently pursuing a masters degree at the ENS Cachan in optimization and computer science.

My main interests are in grounded linguistic modelling (as opposed to statistical language modelling), and as of this date (12.10.2017) I am actively looking for information regarding potential PhD tutors in Europe on this topic.
