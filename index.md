title: About me
---


My name is Théo Matussière, born in 1992 near Paris. I've attended the Ecole polytechnique and recently graduated from the MVA, a research master at the ENS Cachan.

I'm interested in language and its emergence in societies of agents. I'm an article hoarder and keep my papers in my [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/theo-m).
