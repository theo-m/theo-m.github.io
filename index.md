## About me

My name is Théo Matussière. I've attended the _École polytechnique_ and recently graduated from the MVA, a research master at the _ENS Cachan_.

I'm interested in language emergence in societies of agents, representation learning, and in optimization, to a lesser extent. [Here](/files/main-ggle-translate.html) is a google translated document on interesting considerations for language emergence. It's certainly rough around the edges but it's something.

In a more pragmatic setting I'm interested in building tools to make work more interesting by plugging in AI solutions in a smart way.
I have the chance to work on this topic at [Nabla](https://nabla.com), check us out!
