    My intent is to have a blog centered around NLP. Therefore articles  that might be of little interest for people coming here to read about language are listed below.
</p>

<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.misc %}
        <li>
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y"}}:  </span>
            <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}" style="font-family: monospace;">
                {{ post.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
