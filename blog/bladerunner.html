<em>A shiny new thing and an old one</em></p>

<p>I like the first Blade Runner: it combines great atmosphere, cool music, and robots. It also has something else; terrific actors and an underlying mesh of thoughts about human nature, free will and much more. It is filled with numerous symbolical references that make it very enjoyable to watch and rewatch.</p>

<p>I think the second one was good, but not in the same way. It was a spectacle in the first definition of the word; image and sound are well crafted, thrown to the spectator for its pure enjoyment. The synthetizors of the first movie are there, but Hans Zimmer-ed, <em>i.e.</em> put their maximum. And I have not even seen it in an iMax theatre. As a side note I think that this reveals the fact that to make theatres relevant in the Neftlix era productors must make experience being fully sensorial so as to not be replicable at home.</p>

<p>I felt the movie lacked the metaphysical interrogations the first raises, or more accurately bears in itself. Of course it tries to bring questions about human nature, but those questions are not as important to the story, where they were essential to Deckard’s survival. Here these questions are almost anecdotal — if replicants can give birth, what exactly does it mean? The first movie didn’t provide with answers either, but the questions were diverse, and they pertained to the hero himself. Here the metaphysical interrogations are a tool for the plot in that if they give birth then they are auto-sufficient and it motivates the big corporation to hunt them down. Besides that, what does it matter to the spectator?</p>

<p>So despite its really well done atmosphere, the splendid visuals and overwhelming soundtrack, this new iteration lacks the spiritual intensity of the first one. In the same way that the visuals of Blade Runner are dark and dirty while the new one is shinier, more cosy, something else didn’t pass through; its deep philosophical elements.</p>
