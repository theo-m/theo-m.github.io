# Wrapping up TalkieWalkie

<span className="text-gray-500 text-sm">2021/12/06</span>

I've decided to stop working [TalkieWalkie](https://talkiewalkie.app) for the foreseeable future.
Despite not looking for VC funding before we were confident in our value proposal, we've been offered an exceptional pre-seed offer with top VCs and a dream network of BAs and advisors.
This was one of the high point of the adventure, but it was closely followed by the departure of my co-founder.

I'm keeping some documents from the project: you can read the first "white paper" [here](/talkiewalkie.html), and the first and last semi serious [pitch deck](/tw-slides.pdf).

It's surely not realistic, but I'm still hoping to out something from these past few months.
The iOS app is ~70% done, but the recent leaving of my co-founder has hit me enough to make it really hard to keep working on it.
Recently I've been thinking that the best thing to expose for the project would be the empathetic Speech-To-Text (STT) technology.
I have the vision and ideas for it, and compared to iOS work, this is the kind of thing I know how to do.

As expected, the STT models won't make it out to general release due to lack of time and priority in my current life.
I'm opening up the [repo](https://github.com/talkiewalkie/talkiewalkie) - it contains a couple of semi cool things, in state sync-ing and backend.
