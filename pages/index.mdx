# Théo Matussière

👋 Hi, my name is Théo!

I'm an engineer living in Paris 🇫🇷 with a training in **mathematics** and **machine learning**.
In the three years since my graduation I have worked as a research engineer at Facebook AI Research, Nabla & HuggingFace.
At Nabla I've learnt generalist software engineering and taken a taste for product-oriented engineering.

I've been working on my own startup, [talkiewalkie](https://www.talkiewalkie.app), for the past few months.
The journey has been wild but it's time for me to archive the project, and starting to look for my next opportunity.

<br />
Things I'm looking for in my next job:

1. trust, earnestness and kindness,
2. close to the product and its users,
3. an impactful position mixing engineering and (product or management)

<br />
Things that I can do or have done:

- lead state of the art research in NLP - from framing the questions to planning and executing experiences,
- develop user facing experiences in web and mobile,
- manage back-end operations,
- a-to-z development and shipping of NLP features in production,
- user research & interviews,
- lead small teams,
- recruit and onboard new team members,
- product ownership
