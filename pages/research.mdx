# Unborn projects

- LMSVG: given a satisfying vectorizer network, investigate description lengths pressures.
- PRIMITIVES: toy with https://github.com/fogleman/primitive and object recognition networks to find the minimal number of shapes required for "meaning" to emerge.
- NCAs: all things ALIFE are fascinating, relevant links: slackermanz, mordvinstev...
- EMERGLANG: M. Hahn at Stanford, etc.
