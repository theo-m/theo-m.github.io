        <h3>What is TalkieWalkie?</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            TalkieWalkie is a new way to experience your surroundings. It's a
            simple thing, yet it's a full <em>new medium</em>. It's not just a
            podcast, it's the old bland museum audio guide, finally being
            released into the wild!
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Here, There and Everywhere</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            What if all around you existed trails of audio, some fun and
            entertaining, others focused on history, and others simply stories,
            tied to a place - allowing you to be <em>here</em>, and
            <em>there</em>! Wherever you go, a new city to explore, the life
            path of a novelist you like taking you around, the places of a film
            you enjoyed...
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Everywhere</em> you go, others have gone. Some famous, some fun,
            some full of knowledge, they all have something to share about where
            you're standing right now.
          </p>

        <h3>The origin story</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            While visiting Venice's San Marco Basilica in early 2020, my partner
            and I took the available audio guides. They had such poor content
            that I've been thinking about audio guides since. They're such a
            boring, mundane object, they never spark joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would confess that I was not expecting much to begin with, but I
            should have, we all should have better standards for these. We
            should expect that they push us into the mystery, bring us at the
            center of the stories that took place where you stand, etc.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>The opportunity</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            The Pokemon go enthusiasm showed how powerful mixing
            <em>here</em> and <em>there</em> is, how broad its apppeal is.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the COVID crisis, we are all longing for meaningful
            experiences, experiences that take us outside and re-enchant the
            real. Bringing them the means to create these walks, share them and
            enjoy them, either alone or with friends is a tremendous
            opportunity!
          </p>

        <h3>Making it something</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            There are multiple open questions for the realization of the
            TalkieWalkie vision. In line with the
            <a href="https://ycombinator.com">YC</a> philosophy, I don't want to
            spend to much time figuring out the business model yet. But I also
            can't ignore it, because much of the shape of TalkieWalkie is yet to
            be determined.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the talks I've already had I gathered an alternative:
            TalkieWalkie can be two things: a YouTube, with user generated
            content, bringing its creativity to the new medium and its
            moderating challenges, or a Netflix, with managed productions. It
            can be a YouTube with a production arm, and it probably should.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still have no idea what's best - if you have an idea or an
            opinion,

          <p>
            If any part of this appeals to you, I'm always happy to discuss!
            I've set six months to myself to find co-founders to launch this
            exciting prospect - do reach out if you think of anyone who would
            even simply be interested in the discussion.
